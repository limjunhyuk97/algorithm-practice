# Greedy algorithm
  - arrives at solution by constructing solution set through a sequence of optimal choices (optimization)
  - sequence of local optimal choices produce global optimal solution.
  - use iteration
  - get solution using **solution set**, adding items into it, until solution set represents a solution to instance
  - **steps : selection, feasibility check, solution check**
  - examples
   - constructing MST(Kruskal, Prim), Shortest Path(Dijkstra)
